## About me

You got on my page on github and I'm glad to welcome you, let me tell you a little about myself.

My name is Grigory. I'm 20 years old.
I started my way with programming in the beautiful python language.
Over time, I became interested in web development and began to comprehend this area.
I found out that python has a wonderful framework called Django.

Gradually I started studying it and moved on to writing my own projects.
I also know how to make up and somehow worked with js.
I know the basic php language and sometimes I can write something in it.
I am constantly studying and improving. I am always ready for interesting projects and proposals.
